## Pay attention

- Due to some changes made in `@eslint/core 0.17.0`, it does not work even with config generated via their `init` command. So I locked `@eslint/core` version to `0.16.0` in `package.json` overrides.
- Tested with `pnpm@10.20.0`, but technically it should work well with npm and yarn.
